## Set you Free

This small tool combines search results from pudding and scropus and offers some additional features to save you time in your structured literature search.

## Features
* Enables a coherent structure of the search results.
* Scropus results are used to interpolate fields that are not provided by pubmed such as open access journals
* Excludes duplicates resulting from a common set of search results from both search engines.
* Adds keyword based fields through simple flexible regex definitions.
